        <h2>Audiobooks</h2>
        <p>One thing I really love doing is reading. More recently I have found a love for
           listening to audiobooks. I love how I can listen to audiobooks while cleaning, driving,
           and even going for walks. There really is alot to this world that I am unfamiliar with
           and I love reading books from experts in different fields ranging from business,
           psychology, and more. </p>
        <h2> Excercise</h2>
        <p>I love working out! Recently, I have found  a new found love for working out. I have
          noticed a dramatic increase in my happiness and association with working out. I am sure
          we all have our demons and working out is an outlet for me to relieve stress and feel
          good. I even love going for walks around the park and neighborhood.  </p>
        <h2>Sports/Games</h2>
        <p>I love games! I really really really love games! It could be volleyball, softball,
          baseball, basketball, video games and more. You name the game and I am in. Games/sports
          are just really fun. I love friendlyl competetion and playing games is just so much fun.
          In my opinion it's one of the best things to life. </p>
        <h2>Tv</h2>
        <p>I love watching Mixed martial arts and the UFC. Ufc fights can be incredible to watch. I
          also love watching NFL highlights the end of a sunday night after work. I can watch five
          games and there game highlights in less than an hour. Five normal full games is about
          FIFTEEN HOURS! So essentially I skip all the boring plays and dont miss a thing. I call
          it efficient entertainment. </p>
