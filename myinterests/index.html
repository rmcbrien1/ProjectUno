    <h2>Audiobooks</h2>

        <p> One thing I really love doing is reading. More recently I have found a love for listening to audiobooks. I love how I can listen to audiobooks while cleaning, driving, and even going for walks. There really is alot to this world that I am unfamiliar with and I love reading books from experts in different fields ranging from business, psychology, and more. </p>
        <h2> Excercise</h2>
        <p>I love working out! Recently, I have found  a new found love for working out. I have noticed a dramatic increase in my happiness and association with working out. I am sure we all have our demons and working out is an outlet for me to relieve stress and feel good. I even love going for walks around the park and neighborhood.  </p>
        <h2>Sports/Games</h2>
        <p>I love games! I really really really love games! It could be volleyball, softball, baseball, basketball, video games and more. You name the game and I am in. Games/sports are just really fun. I love friendlyl competetion and playing games is just so much fun. In my opinion it's one of the best things to life. </p>
